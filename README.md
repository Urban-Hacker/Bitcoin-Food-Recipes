# Bitcoin Food Recipies

> A collection of delicious recipies for those who want to say no to fiat food

This is a collection of recipies based on what my grand mother prepared before the advent of industrial food. The recipies included here are based lossly on a few core principles:

0) Based on fresh food that can easily be prepared at home. If my grand mother had to use an industrial rafinery to prepare it, it will not be included here.
1) A low / reduced carbs diet. It does not ban them outright but is compatible for those who do not want or canâ€™t go on a carnivor diet, especially if your friend or family are not on board.
2) Broad enough to include a lot of various dish from different cultures all over the world.
3) No bullshit, only recipies: You will never get the endless wall of text that charaterize recipies website
