# Wholesome Home-Cooked Recipes

> A curated selection of delightful recipes inspired by traditional home cooking

Welcome to our collection of timeless recipes, inspired by the dishes our grandmother prepared before the era of industrialized food. We have carefully chosen each recipe to adhere to a few core principles:

1) **Home-friendly ingredients**: We focus on fresh food that can be easily prepared at home. If our grandmother couldn't prepare it without industrial equipment, you won't find it here.
2) **Low-carb friendly**: While not strictly a low-carb diet, our recipes cater to those who wish to reduce their carbohydrate intake without going full carnivore, making them suitable even for mixed-diet households.
3) **Inspiration**: To learn more about the philosophy behind our recipe selection, visit [perfecthealthdiet.com](https://perfecthealthdiet.com/).
