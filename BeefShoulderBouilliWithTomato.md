# Beef Shoulder Slowly Cooked in Cream with Tomatoes (Bouilli)

> Bouilli, or Pot-au-feu, is a French method of slowly boiling meat. It's an excellent way to cook cuts with silver skin, as the slow boiling process tenderizes the meat.

## Ingredients

* 1 kg Beef Shoulder or Brisket
* [Beef Tallow](Core/BeefTallow.md)
* 250 ml Bone broth (prepared separately)
* 250 ml Cream
* 1 Cabbage
* Tomato extract (choose one with 100% tomato)
* Dried Tomato
* Garlic
* 2 Spring onions or chives
* 2 Tbsp Olive oil (optional)
* Paprika (optional)
* Bay leaves (optional)

## Instructions

### Preparing the meat
1. Melt the beef tallow in a cast iron pot.
2. Sear the meat on all sides to form a crust, about 2-3 minutes per side.
3. Season with salt and pepper.

### Making the bouilli
4. Cut the cabbage into 4 chunks and place them around the meat.
5. Add the bone broth, tomato extract, garlic, and finely chopped spring onions to the pot.
6. Let it simmer slowly over medium-low heat for 30 minutes.
7. Add the dried tomatoes and olive oil, reduce the heat to low, and let it simmer gently for 2 hours.
8. Stir the pot gently from time to time to ensure even cooking.
9. Five minutes before serving, stir in the cream.

## Additional Tips
This dish can be served in two parts: first, a light broth or soup made from the bouilli juices and cream, followed by the meat and cabbage.

You can use a variety of meats with silver skin or connective tissue for this recipe, including pork, oxtail, sausages, or veal.
