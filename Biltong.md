# Biltong (South African Cured Meat)

> This recipe is extreamly easy to do especially if you want to try to do cured meat yourself. It is important to respect the general proportion based on how much beef you have, in doubt put a bit more.

# Ingredients (metric unit)

* 1 kg lean beef meat (shoulder works perfectly)
* 27 ml balsamic vinegar (red wine vinegar works too)
* 23 g salt
* 8 g pepper
* 15 g coriander seed toasted

* 14 ml Worcestershire sauce (optional)
* dry rosmarin (opional)
* dry garlic (optional)

# Instructions

## For the spices
1) Combine the vinegar and the Worcestershire in a container.
2) Toast the coriander seeds and coarsly grind it with the pepper corn.
3) Add the salt and other spices to the grinded pepper & coriander.

## For the meat
1) Remove all the conjuctive tissues and silver skin from the shoulder. It should be lean and not have too much fat.
2) Cut it in steak with the grain of roughly 2cm wide (use your thumb to measure each steak).
3) Put the pieces in the container and poor the spices prepared before.
4) Make sure you turn the meat over and over to cover it in spices. Use all the spices this is important.
5) Put it in a ziplock bag, remove as much air as possible and put it in the fridge for 24h.
6) Massage the bag every 12 hours to evenly distribute the marinade.

## For the curing
1) Remove each biltong pieces from the bag, weight it, write down the weight on a piece of paper and put the meat and the paper on a butcher hook.
2) Hang your biltong in a warm, sunny area with a gently air flow. Ideally the humidity should be at around 50% and the temperature between 21°C and 26°C
3) Depending on your liking, you can wait to get 50% of the weight down or more if you prefer dryer Biltong.
5) Once it reaches the desired weight, make sure there is no mold, simply slice it and enjoy.

# To go further
I personally eat my biltong always fresh, so I will always eat it once ready. In practice you can slice it and preserve in the fridge but I would rather prepare it more often than having non fresh Biltong. I also once got mold after slicing it and puting it back in the fridge due to the condensation.

If you suspect anything bad (mold, dubious colors, etc) throw it away, it might be unsafe for consumption.

Since this is a Bitcoin cooking recipy book, you could potentially use a small Bitcoin miner to regulate the temperature in the room and make sure it has a gentle air flow. Be aware most industrial ASIC are way too powerful for 1kg of meat.
