# Biltong (South African Cured Meat)

> An incredibly simple recipe for those looking to try their hand at making cured meat. It's essential to maintain the correct proportions based on the amount of beef used. If in doubt, use a little extra.

## Ingredients (metric unit)

* 1 kg lean beef meat (shoulder works well)
* 27 ml balsamic vinegar (red wine vinegar is also suitable)
* 23 g salt
* 8 g pepper
* 15 g toasted coriander seeds

* 14 ml Worcestershire sauce (optional)
* Dry rosemary (optional)
* Dry garlic (optional)

## Instructions

### Preparing the spices
1. Combine the vinegar and Worcestershire sauce in a container.
2. Toast the coriander seeds and coarsely grind them with the peppercorns.
3. Add salt and any optional spices to the ground pepper and coriander mixture.

### Preparing the meat
1. Remove all connective tissue and silver skin from the shoulder, leaving lean meat without excess fat.
2. Cut the meat into steaks, approximately 2 cm wide, following the grain (use your thumb as a measurement guide).
3. Place the meat in the container and pour in the prepared spice mixture.
4. Turn the meat several times to ensure even spice coverage. Use all the spice mixture.
5. Transfer the meat to a ziplock bag, remove as much air as possible, and refrigerate for 24 hours.
6. Massage the bag every 12 hours to evenly distribute the marinade.

### Curing the meat
1. Remove each piece of biltong from the bag, weigh it, note the weight on a piece of paper, and attach the meat and paper to a butcher hook.
2. Hang the biltong in a warm, sunny area with gentle airflow. The ideal humidity is around 50%, with a temperature between 21°C and 26°C.
3. Depending on your preference, wait until the biltong loses 50% of its weight or more for drier biltong.
4. Once the desired weight is reached, check for mold, then simply slice and enjoy.

## Additional Tips
I personally prefer to eat my biltong fresh, so I consume it as soon as it's ready. You can slice and store it in the refrigerator, but I'd rather prepare smaller batches more frequently to ensure freshness. Be cautious of mold growth caused by condensation after slicing and refrigerating.

If you notice any mold, discoloration, or other signs of spoilage, discard the biltong, as it may be unsafe for consumption.

As a nod to this being a Bitcoin cookbook, you could potentially use a small Bitcoin miner to regulate the room temperature and ensure a gentle airflow. However, be aware that most industrial ASICs are too powerful for just 1 kg of meat.
